In the age of IoT, businesses are digitalising and moving from pen and paper to screen and keyboard. Many managers are appealing to IoT solutions to better run their companies.

IoT helps businesses improve their sales and marketing by collecting data about their consumers and suggesting actions that would make the business more attractive, resulting in improved sales and presence at the store.

The problem is that IoT is expensive and difficult to implement, and although major businesses will have such solutions implemented, your local café, restaurant and store may not have them! IoT should be accessible for all companies big and small. SmartLocale aims to bring your business to the digital world in minutes, removing the cost and expertise required to set up a system that tracks and predicts sales and presence in the store, café, restaurant or any other small business.

SmartLocale is an application that tracks the number of people that entered the locale and the number of sales carried out every business day. An edge-device is placed at the store’s POS collecting data about the sales and at the entrance of the store counting the number of people entering and leaving the locale. These two values are compared resulting in crucial business indicators.

SmartLocale exceeds existing solutions because of the extremely low price and ease of setup allowing the locale’s manager to implement the solution in minutes and start monitoring the locale’s sales and presence. All the data is centralised in the cloud where it is forecasted to predict the business’ sales and presence for the next period of time allowing the business to prepare in the case of a rainy day.

The manager can access an online, interactive dashboard presenting the historical and forecasted sales and presence in the store. This allows the manager to easily manage their business from their phone, tablet or laptop at any time. The application also allows the business to see which products were sold the most. The application groups all products into three categories defined by the manager and tracks the sale of products from each category.

This device is aimed at small to medium companies specialised in the sale of goods and provision of services. Your local café, store, restaurant or barbers can benefit from this solution. Bring your business in the age of IoT with SmartLocale.
